# Project Instructions

## Running Project
Once you clone project, you will need to install all the packages:
- `cd` into your new folder
- `npm install`

Setup your .env file (refer to `.env.example`):
- Create your `.env` file in the root directory of the project
- Set the values for `APP_ID` and `APP_KEY` (Aylien API Credentials)

After that, run the following commands to start the servers:
- Open a terminal and run: `npm run build-dev` to start the frontend server
- Open another terminal and run: `npm start` to start the backend server

Now, you can easily visit the website on the port 8080: `http://localhost:8080` and you can start testing it out.

Also, you can run JEST tests using the following command:
- `npm run test`
